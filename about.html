                    <p>A modern day gymnasium (as gym used to be called way back in Ancient Greece) is a place for indoor physical workout where various equipment and machines are typically used. For some people, a typical gym is a place where you focus
                        on weight lifting and similar activities.</p>
                    <p class="dark">A gymnasium or GYM is a covered athletic facility. The word GYM is a short translation of "gymnasium", which is Greek. The use of this term is typically seen in the activity and study areas of educational facilities, as well as in
                        athletic and fitness facilities.</p>
